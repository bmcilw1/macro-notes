## Overview

1. Ethereum is currently the second most valuable cryptocurrency.
2. ETH is also one of the most fundamentally important cryptocurrencies, after BTC. Today, most crypto projects depend on the fundamental theses of BTC and ETH being realized in addition to their own. This is true even for projects that aren’t technically built on either platform. ETH is completely separate in its technical implementation from BTC.
3. ETH is a platform to run smart contracts. These are contracts which are created and enforced in software instead of a legal system. ETH can be thought of as self-enforcing programmable money.
4. Almost any crypto can be built on top of ETH. Though alternatives exist, ETH currently hosts most of the other cryptos that are currently being used today.
5. Virtually all of Decentralized Finance (DeFi) is built on ETH. DeFi is a collection of projects that work to replicate every common function of a traditional bank, but in a decentralized way using crypto. DeFi also makes possible many new features that can’t be replicated in the existing traditional finance system.
6. ETH can also replicate most of the functionality of BTC, but it was built for a different purpose than payments or digital gold. Importantly, it currently has no permanent monetary policy (unlike BTC).

## Major Bullish Arguments

1. ETH is the most widely adopted platform for cryptocurrencies. Most projects that are currently in use build on it directly.
2. Almost all of DeFi is built on ETH.
3. ETH is currently undergoing a major transformation that will significantly increase efficiency by many orders of magnitude.
4. ETH is working to transition from proof of work (POW) to proof of stake (POS). In POW, like BTC, miners waste electricity as proof of their truthfulness and sell their coins to cover costs. This increases supply and brings the price down. In POS, stakers lock up their coins as proof of their truthfulness and do not need to sell their coins. This reduces supply and pumps the price up.
