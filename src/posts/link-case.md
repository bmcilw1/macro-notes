## Overview

1. Smart contracts / programmable money is steadily rising in usage today. However, each blockchain is limited to the data available inside its ecosystem. In order to be used for more things, there needs to be a way to "bridge" or LINK data into a blockchain from outside in a way that can be guaranteed to be trustworthy. This is called the Oracle Problem.
2. LINK allows purchasers to request data. Providers bid to supply it and lock up their own money in a "stake." If the purchaser is satisfied with the quality and timeliness of the Provider, the Provider keeps their stake and they are paid the bid. If not a portion of the stake is destroyed and the global reputation of the Provider immediately suffers. Other Providers could then supply the requested data instead.
3. LINK is already one of the most depended upon projects in cryptocurrency. Most projects in the Decentralized Finance (DeFi) space use LINK for external data. Almost any blockchain can increase their usefulness by integrating with secure external data through LINK.
4. LINK is supported and used by several high-profile partnerships including Google and the SWIFT banking network itself. This is the system currently used to facilitate most dollar transfers across most banks worldwide.

## Major Bullish Arguments

1. The problem that LINK provides a solution for is shared by almost every network, app, and token in all of crypto.
2. LINK is already used by most successful and/or new projects in crypto. Many of the smartest and most capable developers in the world are working either directly on LINK or integrating it with their own blockchains.
3. LINK is highly transparent both in and of itself and with its Oracles and so is likely to remain a trusted data source indefinitely.
