## Overview

1. Bitcoin is the original and most fundamentally important cryptocurrency. Virtually every other crypto project depends on the BTC fundamental thesis being realized in addition to their own.
2. BTC functions as digital gold that can act as a secure long-term store of value that cannot be arbitrarily printed or destroyed by governments.
3. BTC allows individuals to transact securely between one another without relying on any third party.
4. These transactions are stored in a public ledger, where all can verify their accuracy perfectly and completely themselves. This is why individuals can transact without trusting any third party.
5. Currently, it is the most valuable crypto.

## Major Bullish Arguments

1. All transactions can be tracked on the Blockchain by all participants. No participant needs to trust any other in order to transact.
2. Today there is massive demand for alternative reserve assets for corporate and county treasuries. Nearly all other forms of existing liquid (easily spendable) capital are currently losing value. This includes currency, government treasuries, corporate bonds, etc. BTC is highly liquid and net-deflationary - its value tends to be preserved over long periods of time. The worldâ€™s capital has historically pooled into the most safe, low-cost, and widely accepted forms of liquidity.
3. BTC has been compared to a foreign bank account that has no minimum fees and is accessible to all.
4. The rising generation prefers digital money to physical money.
5. Major countries are increasingly using monetary policy as a weapon. Countries locked out of the current dominant system will likely seek an alternative.
6. History provides thousands of examples of fiat (Government-issued) currencies. Every example has eventually become worthless. The average lifespan of a fiat currency system is only 30 years. The USD is one of the oldest with its current form being just over 40 years old (Its parent was the gold-backed currency also called USD).
