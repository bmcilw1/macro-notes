## Overview

1. Uniswap (UNI) is the largest Decentralized Exchange (DeX). A DeX allows users to trade cryptocurrencies without needing a company to act as a neutral third party to facilitate the transaction. DeXs are currently among the most heavily used applications yet developed on the blockchain.
1. Uniswap is a smart contract protocol that currently runs directly on the Ethereum blockchain. It can be used to "swap" any ERC-20 (a token specification) token on Ethereum, which cover the majority of cryptocurrencies that speculators would like to acquire and trade.
1. Uniswap is so heavily used that it has become among the largest individual sources of transactions on Ethereum. This unprecedented usage of ETH has driven up the cost of Ethereum transactions to astronomically high levels, which are currently driven primarily by Uniswap usage. The extreme fees on ETH have created a temporary crisis and accelerated the need for ETH scaling solutions.
