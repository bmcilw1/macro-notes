## Overview

1. Uniswap (UNI) is an early pioneer of and largest Decentralized Exchange (DeX). A DeX allows users to trade cryptocurrencies without needing a company to act as a neutral third party to facilitate the transaction. Additionally, they allow users to exchange tokens directly from their chosen wallets without needing to first send them to an exchange. DeXs are currently among the most heavily used applications yet developed on the blockchain, already facilitating over $140 Billion dollars in swaps since its creation. More and more transactions are happening on DeXs vs on traditional exchanges.
1. Uniswap is a smart contract protocol that currently runs directly on the Ethereum blockchain. It can be used to "swap" any ERC-20 (a token specification) token on Ethereum, which cover the majority of cryptocurrencies that speculators would like to acquire and trade.
1. Uniswap is so heavily used that it has become among the largest individual sources of transactions on Ethereum. This unprecedented usage of ETH has driven up the cost of Ethereum transactions to astronomically high levels, which are currently driven primarily by Uniswap usage. The extreme fees on ETH have created a temporary crisis and accelerated the need for scaling solutions both for ETH and UNI.
1. ETH is working on implementing ETH 2.0 to address scaling. However, ETH 2.0 is still expected to take at least a couple years to deploy at best. Meanwhile, UNI is working on moving the bulk of their transactions off-chain (called layer-2) via a technology called Zero Knowledge Proofs (or ZK Roll-ups). This is a technology that allows most transactions to occur outside of Ethereum and only write a summary of the results to the blockchain. It is expected that UNI will come out with their layer-2 solution around May 2021.
1. Uniswap has helped pioneer the concept of a DeX and kept pushing the limits of what's possible in the space. Recently they have announced V3 of their protocol. With V3, UNI has solved many fundamental limitations of DeXs and brought many additional features that traders are used to in centralized exchanges. UNI has given their Liquidity Providers (or LPs, which are like market makers in traditional exchanges) fine grained control over how their capital is used and the ability to deposit one token in stead of matching pairs. This is called Concentrated Liquidity Pools. This is expected to make UNI the deepest (most liquid) and most efficient market of cryptocurrencies in existence. Additionally, the new flexibility for LPs also for the first time creates the ability for range orders - which are similar to limit orders in traditional exchanges.
1. Other important features are also added to V3 including a bug bounty and a change in licence that makes it illegal for other projects to directly copy UNI's source code, while still allowing anyone who wants access to see the full source code. Also price oracles are greatly improved, allowing for more accurate pricing of assets.

## Major Bullish Arguments

1. With V3, UNI has again redefined the limits of what is possible in a DeX. UNI has provided features that are not available elsewhere. Even if competitors copy features, the liquidity of their LPs cannot currently compete with UNI. This means that orders and especially large orders are expected to execute better on Uniswap than any other platform. This means that UNI should continue to be very attractive for many users.
1. One of the first things people tend to do after obtaining cryptocurrency is seek out ways of gaining a yield on their holdings. With Concentrated Liquidity Pools, token holders have a new way that they can put their capital to work and earn reliable yield by supplying liquidity according to customizable market conditions. LPs in UNI should have good opportunities to make returns on their capital by adding it to Concentrated Liquidity Pools, without needing to trust third party custodians.
1. The combined effect of point 1 and 2 creates a virtuous cycle by adding even more liquidity to the already leading UNI pools and thus enticing even more users with even better order executions. These new users generates more fees for the LPs, which entice even greater participation in LPs, and the cycle continues.
