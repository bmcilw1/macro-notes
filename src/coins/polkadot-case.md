## Overview

1. Polkadot (DOT) presents a fundamental redesign of blockchains and an alternative to smart-contract platforms such as Ethereum. [Gavin Wood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gavin_Wood){target=\_blank} is the founder of DOT and was also a co-founder and the CTO of Ethereum.
1. Wood believes the future will contain not just one dominant but many differing blockchains. This is primarily based on the observation that no matter how well a general-purpose system is built, eventually it will perform sub-optimally when compared to special-purpose systems at least for some use cases.
1. DOT's primary focus is to make interoperability between vastly differing blockchains easy. If Ethereum is a Layer-1 network for running smart contracts, DOT strives to be a Layer-0 that can glue many Layer-1 blockchains together seamlessly. The DOT Layer-0 protocol is like a "federal government" that can support arbitrarily many custom Layer-1 "state governments" called parachains. The DOT protocol has a basic "constitution" outlining how these parachain "states" can interact. It also defines ways that the DOT common "constitution" can be amended by vote as needed. This provides much more flexibility than can be found on more static systems such as Ethereum 1.0 or 2.0.
1. Wood is expecting that if this Layer-0 protocol or "constitution" is built, companies and entrepreneurs will build many special-purpose Layer-1 parachains on top of DOT for different purposes. To this end, DOT also provides extensive tooling to help make designing a custom parachain as simple as possible for developers.
1. DOT can also connect with other blockchains that are not running as part of the DOT network. It does this through oracles that carry data back and forth between blockchains. The primary provider of Oracles for the DOT network is Chainlink, the largest system of oracles in blockchain.
1. The DOT team has created a parachain that is able to run code written for Ethereum or the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). This Layer-1 parachain is called Moonbeam and it is able to run Ethereum code with minimal changes. DOT also supports running Ethereum code on a system called Plasm, which is a Layer-2 protocol that is able to offer even greater performance than is possible on Layer-1.
1. Additional parachains are also being built on DOT including one capable of running smart contracts with Web Assembly (WASM). Web Assembly is a secure and stable runtime existing for several years and built for web browsers. Using WASM for running smart contracts make developing some applications much easier than is possible in the EVM.

## Major Bullish Arguments

1. Wood's observation that many special-purpose systems can outperform a general-purpose system is true in many areas of technology and real life. This suggests that the many-blockchain future is very likely to occur. DOT makes operating in a future with many different blockchains much easier than was previously possible.
