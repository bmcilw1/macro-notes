## Overview

1. Polkadot (DOT) presents a fundamental redesign of blockchains and an alternative to smart-contract platforms such as Ethereum. [Gavin Wood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gavin_Wood){target=\_blank} is the founder of DOT and was also a co-founder and the CTO of Ethereum.
1. Gavin Wood believes the future will contain not just one dominant but many different blockchains. This is primarily based on the observation that no matter how well a general-purpose system is built, eventually it will perform sub-optimally to special-purpose systems in at least some use cases.
1. DOT's primary focus is to make interoperability between vastly differing blockchains easy. If Ethereum is a Layer-1 network for running smart contracts, DOT strives to be a Layer-0 that can glue many Layer-1 blockchains together seamlessly. The DOT protocol is like a "federal government" that can support arbitrarily many custom "state governments." The DOT protocol's Layer-0 is a "federal government" that consists of a basic "constitution" outlining how Layer-1 blockchains "states" can interact. It also defines ways that the DOT Layer-0 "constitution" can be amended by vote as needed.
