## Overview

1. The Graph (GRT) is a decentralized protocol for indexing and querying blockchain data. An index is a saved cache of data that can be used to query data much faster than searching blockchains directly. Similarly, Google creates indexes to search the web quickly. For this reason The Graph has been called "The Google of Blockchains."
1. Almost every decentralized application (dApp) built in crypto utilizes indexes to access its data. Before The Graph, almost all of these indexing solutions were custom built in-house for each blockchain/application. The Graph is a decentralized protocol allows companies to not need to re-implement this common work. Instead, they can use the decentralized Graph Protocol to get timely and reliable data for their blockchain of choice. Some of the largest projects have utilized The Graph in their dApps including Uniswap, Synthetics, and Aave.
1. The Graph can support data not just for the Ethereum blockchain it's implemented on, but also for arbitrary blockchains. Currently, it supports Ethereum and other popular layer-1 and layer-2 blockchains.
1. The Graph serves queries through Graph Query Language (GraphQL), which is a common standard that makes it easy for almost any developer to use even if they are not blockchain experts.
