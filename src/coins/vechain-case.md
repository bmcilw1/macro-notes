## Overview

1. VeChain 2.0, while initially focused on supply-chain management, has broadened the scope of its blockchain to service enterprise applications, regardless of their domain.
1. VeChainThor is it's upgraded native blockchain that includes an Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) that allows it to execute arbitrary smart contracts. This puts it in competition with other smart contract providers with ETH, BNB, DOT, ADA, and others. However, unlike most others VeChain especially focuses on servicing enterprise-level customers.

1. VeChain (VET) is a cryptocurrency focused on revolutionizing supply chain management world-wide. Currently, guaranteeing product quality and safety is extremely difficult and in many cases financially impossible in today's world. Fake or counterfeit products, sub-standard replacements, items past expiration, or other cheats are constant challenges for all involved. These challenge consumers, manufacturers, and regulators alike. The supply-chain industry desperately needs a better way to monitor, detect, and address such cheats both for intentional as well as accidental occurrences.
1. The key function of VeChain allows suppliers to record and track the entire history of their products at every stage of production. This is done by issuing a digital tag for each individual product at the start of the product's creation. As the product is created/grown/baked/shipped/verified etc, an entry is made on VeChain for each stage of its development. All-in-all, this provides a complete and accurate history for a product - where it was shipped, how it was made, where components came from, guarantees on quality or anything else that companies choose to record on the blockchain. Finally, this history can be made available to customers as digital evidence towards the authenticity and quality of that product.
1. Each digital assentation of events following a tag is backed by a financial claim. If any inaccuracy, fraud, or error is later found in a validated chain of events, those responsible will lose a proportionally large amount of money on the VeChain network. This follows a model similar to how other oracles introduce external data into the blockchain. This ensures a high degree of reliability in all information stored.
1. VeChain utilizes a two-token model for the financials of their network. VET is used for ... while VTHO is used for.
1. VET is extremely well diversified in its token distribution.
1. VeChain runs on top of the Ethereum network, allowing for easy connectivity with many other cryptocurrency projects.
1. VeChain is coming out with a key update in their consensus system which they call 2.0. This is expected to vastly increase throughput of the system and remove the possibility of hard-forks in their network.
1. VeChain has a large presence in China.
1. VeChain is currently experimenting with the potential of diversifying the network to providing solutions for NFTs and DeFi.
