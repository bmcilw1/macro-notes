## Overview

1. VeChain (VET) is a cryptocurrency focused on revolutionizing supply chain management world-wide. Currently, guaranteeing product quality and safety is extremely difficult and in many cases financially impossible in today's world. Fake or counterfeit products, sub-standard replacements, products past expiration, or other cheats on quality, timeliness, or safety are constant challenges for all involved. This effects consumers, manufacturers, and regulators alike. The supply-chain industry needs a better way to monitor, detect, and address such cheats both for intentional as well as accidental occurrences.
1. The key function of VeChain allows suppliers to record and track the entire history of their products at every stage of production. This is done by issuing a digital tag for each individual product at the start of the product's creation. As the product is created/grown/baked/shipped etc, an entry is made on VeChain for each stage of its development. All-in-all, this provides a complete and accurate history for a product - where it was shipped, how it was made, where components came from, or anything else that companies choose to record on the blockchain. Finally, this history can be made available to customers as digital evidence towards the authenticity and quality of that product.
1. Each digital assentation of events following a tag is backed by a validator. If any inaccuracy, fraud, or error is later found in a validated chain of events, the validator and those responsible will lose a proportionally large amount of money to the VeChain network. This follows a model similar to how oracles introduce external data into the blockchain with a high degree of trust.
1. VeChain utilizes a two-token model for the financials of their network. VET is used for ... while VTHO is used for.
