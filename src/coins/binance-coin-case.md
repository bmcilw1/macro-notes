## Overview

1. Binance is by volume the largest centralized exchange for cryptocurrencies.
1. Binance created Binance Coin (BNB) which runs on the Binance Chain (BC) and offered its users lower fees for using it as a trading pair on their exchange. As the exchange grew in usage, the price of BNB has increased.
1. In 2020 Binance also launched Binance Smart Chain (BSC), which is a smart contract platform capable of running decentralized applications (dApps) meant for Ethereum _mostly_ without modification. However, various different tradeoffs must be accepted for projects that choose this route as there are some critical differences between the protocols.
1. Ethereum's speed has plummeted and transaction fees have skyrocketed with the meteoric rise of DeFi and Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) bringing real usage to the blockchain.
1. As ETH continues to work on improvements for better scalability, some projects have moved to BSC to grow with lower fees today. In particular, some Decentralized Exchanges (DEXs) have launched their protocols on BSC and thus BNB.
1. BSC uses BNB for transaction fees and therefore as the main monetary token of the protocol.

## Major Bullish Arguments

1. Binance is the largest centralized exchange making it a trusted party for many.
1. Binance through BSC is positioned to capitalize on growth in both the centralized and decentralized exchange markets.
1. Binance is proving itself to be one of the fastest-moving and most innovative companies involved in the cryptocurrency space.
1. Binance has the ability to continue to announce and deliver on new projects indefinitely, further pumping the price of BNB.

## Major Counterarguments

1. BSC is MUCH more centralized than ETH.
   - BSC's security depends on only 21 validators which are rotated daily from within the total staker pool. Users stake BNB for a chance of becoming a validator. Each day the top 21 highest staked nodes are designated as the validators to validate all transactions for that day. This is called Proof of Staked Authority (PoSA). ETH, on the other hand, is much more decentralized in validation and governance.
1. DEXs are eating the business of centralized exchanges. Eventually, Binance may not be profitable except as a Fiat (currency) onramp.
   - This is perhaps why Binance launched the BSC to profit from the rise of DEXs. The company should be able to attract business or at least speculation if it merely continues to attract or copy popular dApps onto its own system.
1. The value created by dApps such as DEXs may remain more within the app than leaking down to the host protocol.
   - This may prove to be the case. No one yet knows the portion of value that will remain secured within the token layer vs the applications that are built on them. However, it seems reasonable to suppose that the overall value in a token should remain somewhat proportional to the total value created and used on it.
