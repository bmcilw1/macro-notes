## Overview

1. Cardano (ADA) was developed as a smart-contract platform and an alterative to Ethereum. Charles Hoskinson is the founder of ADA and was also an early founding member of ETH's team. With ADA he is working to create a new platform as an attempt to fix ETH's issues in a different way.
1. The entire team(s) on ADA is staffed by world-class developers and academics, who themselves are among the best in the industry. It has arguably the single most distinguished team currently operating in cryptocurrency, which truly is an astounding accomplishment.
1. ADA has developed most of their protocol through the rigorous process of High-Assurance Code. This means that features began as academic papers which are then submitted for formal academic peer review. Each paper is then mathematically proven to be correct. Upon passing through that, it is translated into a high-level code representation. It is then extensively tested that the code matches the paper exactly. Then, various security threats are simulated and further testing is done. Finally, the code is then translated into a more preformat variant ready to be used in production and tested that it exactly matches the other two representations. This process produces the most reliable code that engineering and academia can produce.
1. Because of the peer-review process, the algorithms presented in ADA are also the highest-performing that academia and engineering can currently produce.
1. ADA made a bold technical choice to leverage a functional programming language called Haskell. In practice this means that developers will greatly decrease the amount of bugs deployed in their code, which is essential in financial applications. It also means that it will be much easier to mathematically prove the correctness of projects built on it. These effects cannot be easily replicated in non-functional languages supported on other platforms.
1. ADA is fully open-source (the code is public) much more decentralized than some of its competitors. Additional features are on the roadmap to fulfil this ethos such as built-in governance by the community.
1. ADA implements a public treasury. This provides funds to support improvements throughout the entire lifetime of the protocol.
1. Where ETH is working on ETH 2.0 to become more scalable, ADA can handle super-scale. As the network gains more users, it becomes even faster.
1. ADA is implemented as a Proof of Stake (PoS) coin.
1. ADA is developed to make interoperability between blockchains easy. This is important as the number of blockchains continues to grow.
1. ADA has claimed and maintained a spot in the top 10 cryptocurrencies for several years and now is in the top 5.
